        <h5>Contribution and sacrifice of doctors during covid crisis</h5><hr>
    <p>The second wave of COVID came like a Tsunami and caught us all unaware. As doctors who had been managing COVID patients from the first wave in 2020, and who had kept abreast with the latest developments regarding the virus, the viciousness of the infectivity and steepness 
        of rise in cases was shocking. Within a short period of first two weeks of April, Delhi and many parts of the country were engulfed in a medical and social nightmare. <br><br>    
       As the healthcare infrastructure got overwhelmed by sheer number of COVID patients, the professional resilience, the courage, and devotion to duty ,which the frontline healthcare workers demonstrated was exemplary. 
       By the third week of April,the rising covid cases caused shortage of beds and oxygen,more doctors and nurses were deployed to COVID wards .
       The Emergency Department of many hospitals became like a war zone, overfilled  with patients on stretchers requiring oxygen support and with ambulances standing outside with deteriorating patients
      The doctors were frantically rushing around giving care to all including the ones in ambulances outside, trying to segregate COVID from non-COVID patients, making sure all protection protocols were 
      also maintained to prevent spread and still treat extremely distressed patient promptly. And all this was performed while wearing full PPE for sometimes 12-hours at a stretch in which one feels very uncomfortable
      as cannot even go to the bathroom or drink water. As all patients were sick the decision of who was sickest of the sicker was not easy and weighed heavily on each doctor’s mind. While being concerned and saddened 
      many times that a deteriorating patient may succumb, every doctor continued to fight for patients’ lives giving the highest level of critical care expertise, providing confidence, comfort
     and hope to all. Added to this very shortly were few extremely distressing scenarios: all doctors were receiving at least 50 or more phone calls/messages daily from patients, relatives, 
     friends suffering from COVID, many of them requiring oxygen and requesting (sometimes pleading) for admission, it was panic at its worst…a heartrending scenario.      
  <br><br>   
        Many doctors felt like soldiers fighting the war with depleting ammunition in trying to save the nation ,knew that the country was relying on the doctors, it was the doctor’s selfless duty….to bury personal sorrows, grief, fears, family concerns and still have confidence,
        comfort and smiles on their face so that patients could see HOPE .In this second wave of COVID more than 800-doctors lost their lives due to COVID in the line of duty in the service of their country and its people. Our respect and prayers for them as they sacrificed their lives so that other could live.

     <h5>challenges faced by doctors</h5><hr>
     <p>
        The coronavirus disease(COVID-19) pandemic has caused increasing challenges for healthcare professionals globally.Covid second wave was the toughest time in a doctor’s life.While most professionals worked from home, this is one profession where professionals have been recruited for in-person work.While on one hand 
        people across India and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors, health-care workers, and medical staff members are leading the
        battle against COVID-19 from the front.<br><br> In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges.The lack of a definite cure for the infection makes their work extra tough and 
        there is also the added pressure of calming the nerves of the patients and their families. For this, the doctors not only have to attend to patients in person but also have to stay connected to them over the phone and through video conferencing.
        Doctors are facing tremendous difficulties at work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these obstacles, healthcare professionals have adapted to deal with the prevailing health crisis.Since the coronavirus outbreak, doctors have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.
         <br><br>
         The fight hasn’t been without sacrifice. India lost over 798 doctors to Covid-19 during the pandemic.Needless to say, doctors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease.According to the information provided by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/798-doctors-died-during-second-wave-of-covid-19-max-deaths-in-delhi-ima-121063000130_1.html">IMA</a>, most of the doctors between 30 to 55 years have lost their lives during the second wave of
         Covid-19, including resident doctors and doctors working as interns. Apart from these doctors, some pregnant women doctors have also lost their lives in the line of duty
        
        <br><br>  
       Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones.The threat of them catching the disease and infecting their own families also looms large over them, due to which most of the doctors 
       have given up going homes and have shifted to solitary accommodations, where they go to take rest after completing their duty hours, which could stretch to 15 or even 18 hours in a day. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and
       deserves lifelong gratitude on our end.

    <h5>A tribute to some of the doctors who died from COVID-19</h5><hr>

   <p class="tree">Dr KK Aggarwal echoed the spirit of many healthcare workers across the country who have been working relentlessly and selflessly to treat, educate and vaccinate people against COVID-19
   “The show must go on”, said 62-year-old Dr KK Aggarwal, the Former President of the Indian Medical Association and a Padma Shri recipient, in one of his last videos. Dr Aggarwal died of 
   COVID-19 on the night of May 17 this year and soon his video where he declared that he represents the collective consciousness of the medical profession went viral on social media. In an attempt to educate the citizens about the infectious disease, COVID care and bust myths, the cardiologist had created hundreds of videos.
   <br>
   </p>
   <br>
        <h2><u> Dr Jagadish Rai</u></h2>
   <img  width="20%" src="https://w.ndtvimg.com/sites/3/2020/11/05191623/COVID_Warrior_From_Karnataka_Died_Due_To_COVID-19_Infection_660x330.jpg" />

 offer. Despite being a senior citizen and having underlying leukemia, Dr Jagadish Rai continued to work six and a half days a week even during a pandemic. Dr Rai had his own clinic and was associated with a nursing home close by. He was not posted on COVID duty per se officially but continued seeing patients in his
  private practice, many of whom were COVID positive, who were denied medical attention elsewhere.</p>
  <br>
        <h2><u> Dr Anas Mujahid</u></h2>
   <img  width="20%" src="https://w.ndtvimg.com/sites/3/2021/07/01123922/Dr-Anas-Mujahid-300x225.jpg" />

   <img  width="20%" src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7350477/bin/IJO-68-939-g006.jpg" />
   <p class="tree">The Iranian doctor, Shirin Rouhani, also lost her life while treating coronavirus patients. Her determination and will power was such that she continued to treat patients till her last breath even when she herself was on IV. She knew she could not rest because of the shortage of doctors and medical
     workers to cater to the needs of patients.</p>
     <br>
     <h2><u>Dr. Usama Riaz</u></h2>

He was busy fighting the deadly virus with utmost bravery and confidence
 when he contracted the virus. Upon showing symptoms, he was rushed to the hospital and was put on a ventilator but he could not make it. He proved to be a real hero by sacrificing his life while saving the lives of many.

<br>
<h2><u> Dr. Israel Bactol</u></h2>
<img  width="20%" src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7350477/bin/IJO-68-939-g007.jpg" />

    <h5>conclusion</h5><hr>
    <p> In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons.Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives,
        they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own  lives at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors. 
         Dressed in full body suits, doctors have taken the coronavirus pandemic head-on and helped India through two disastrous waves of the pandemic over a year-and-a-half.
        <br><br>
        Most importantly, we must realise the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and 
        more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing will be a greater
         tribute to the health-care workers than this.
         The sacrifice of doctors and healthcare workers across the globe will not go to waste. Humanity will always be grateful to them for what they are doing during these unprecedented times. The respect for healthcare professionals has grown manifolds in the hearts of people.
         It is good to see that the Government of India along with the governments worldwide have decided to allocate more budget for healthcare in their respective countries. The world is taking the health, healthcare professionals and hospitals more seriously, as it appears. 
         More work is expected to be done for hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in India as well as in countries across the world.</p>
